This project aims to develop a fruit fly counter Internet of Things device. On these pages are instructions to retrofit a fruit fly trap such as the BioTrap into an internet connected smart device using readily available electronics and open source software.

The trap electronics can connect to a home wifi and send a data stream using MQTT protocol to a cloud broker and dashboard. In this example we use a broker and dashboard from losant.com to collect the fly count data.

We would like develop smart trap to refine the electronics and build a trap network for monitoring of fruit flies.
